# primes_multiplication_table
A program that prints out a multiplication table based on prime numbers.

Run 

node main.js

Test functions are included for major functionality at the bottom of each file.

Analyses of the time complexities of each portion of the program are included in the comments.

The algorithm for generating N primes is included, but the time complexity is not polynomial, so it would not be performant for large N.
